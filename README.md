Hi, I’m @DanielCangrejo from Colombia, a Systems Engineer graduated from ECCI University.
I’m passionate about programming, especially working with Java, Oracle, and backend technologies.
I have 3 years of experience in the field and I’m always eager to keep learning.
Currently, I’m diving into Big Data to expand my skillset.

Outside of work, I enjoy gym training and sports, which help me stay active and balanced.
Feel free to connect with me for collaboration or just to say hi!
